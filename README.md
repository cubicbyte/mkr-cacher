# mkr-cacher

This is my first Go project - a module for caching data from the mkr.org.ua API,
necessary for [sute-schedule-bot](https://github.com/cubicbyte/sute-schedule-bot)
to work when the schedule API is down.

> **Note**
> Currently WIP

# Setup

*To build this module you need **64-bit** gcc version ~9.5.0 in PATH (v12 doesn't work),
go compiler and a bit of IQ.*

Install:
```shell
go get github.com/cubicbyte/mkr-cacher
```
Build:
```shell
go build -o <output file path> github.com/cubicbyte/mkr-cacher
```

# Usage

Will be added in the future
