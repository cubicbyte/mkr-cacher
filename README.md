# mkr-cacher

This is my first Go project - a module for caching data from the mkr.org.ua API,
necessary for [sute-schedule-bot](https://github.com/cubicbyte/sute-schedule-bot)
to work when the schedule API is down.

> **Note**
> Currently WIP

# Setup

*To install this module you need **64-bit** gcc version ~9.5.0 in PATH (v12 doesn't work),
go compiler and a bit of IQ.*

```shell
go install github.com/cubicbyte/mkr-cacher@latest
```
Now the executable file is located at `$GOPATH/bin/mkr-cacher`
(to view gopath, run `go env GOPATH`)

# Usage

Will be added in the future
